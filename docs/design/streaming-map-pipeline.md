# Streaming Map pipeline design

## Context

CSWUnity realizes streamed CSW presentation data in Unity. It does not generate
maps and does not own source formats.

The responsibilities are divided across three repositories:

| Repository | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [CSW](https://saab.ghe.com/saab/CSW) | CSW architecture and engine-neutral SceneManager implementations |
| [CSWMapGenerator](https://saab.ghe.com/saab/CSWMapGenerator) | Imports geospatial source data and generates, previews, and publishes GZD maps |
| CSWUnity | Consumes C# CSW SceneManager buffers and realizes streamed content in Unity |

GizmoSDK is the shared foundation below CSW. Gizmo3D owns GZD database loading,
the native scene graph, coordinate data, traversal, and dynamic loading.

## End-to-end data flow

    BUILDERS --> UNITY["Unity objects and resources"]
    UNITY --> MODULES["Optional shader and GPU modules"]
```

## Map generation and publication

CSWMapGenerator provides the CSW World Asset Maker workflow:

1. import and classify source geospatial datasets;
2. configure feature and attribute mappings;
3. select datasets, build extent, coordinate system, and output settings;
4. build the map with SceneBuilder workers;
5. preview the generated map in MapEditor; and
6. publish the GZD map to a location accessible through a supported URL.

Map generation remains outside the CSWUnity runtime boundary.

## Runtime loading

1. The host configures one or more map source URLs in CSWUnity.
2. CSWUnity submits correlated map commands to the C# CSW SceneManager.
3. CSW SceneManager asks GizmoSDK to resolve the source, inspect its header,
   validate coordinates, and establish ROI/dynamic loaders.
4. CSW SceneManager uses camera and refresh commands to update traversal,
   culling, LOD, and streaming.
5. CSW SceneManager emits typed frame and structural buffers.
6. The CSWUnity receiver transfers those buffers without invoking Unity APIs.
7. The Unity main thread stages and commits changes through registered
   realizers.
8. Resource services allocate, share, update, and recycle Unity resources.
9. Optional feature modules decorate or render the committed scene.

## Source-format boundary

GZD is required for the first production version. Future streamed formats are
integrated below the common CSW scene protocol.

CSWUnity may consume optional format metadata, but core lifecycle, frame
ordering, identities, and common realizers shall not depend on GZD classes.

## Coordinate flow

CSW SceneManager publishes the information needed to establish the Map
Coordinate Context, including the Map Origin `GeoPosition` for georeferenced
maps. CSWUnity retains numeric `GeoPosition` values, Global 3D Positions, and
Local Origin Offsets in double precision. It subtracts the active Local Origin
Offset before narrowing to Local 3D Position and then applies the Unity Viewer
Coordinate Mapping to a specifically named Unity position frame.

Camera data travels in the opposite direction: CSWUnity snapshots the active
Unity camera, applies the inverse Unity mapping and Local 3D localization to
obtain its Global 3D Camera Pose, and submits that pose before requesting a
refresh. The composed Viewer Transform may execute both stages, but shall not
apply the Local Origin Offset twice.

## Ownership boundaries

| Concern | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Source datasets and build settings | CSWMapGenerator |
| GZD generation and publication | CSWMapGenerator |
| Source-format reading and native scene | GizmoSDK |
| `GeoPosition` and Global 3D conversion | GizmoSDK `gzCoordinate` |
| Global-to-Local 3D localization contract | Shared coordinate boundary |
| Map lifecycle, traversal, dynamic loading, and scene buffers | C# CSW SceneManager |
| Local 3D to named Unity position mapping | CSWUnity viewer adapter |
| Thread transfer and frame application | CSWUnity |
| Unity-object conversion | CSWUnity realizers |
| Unity resource lifetime | CSWUnity resource services |
| Optional shaders and GPU features | CSWUnity feature modules |
| Product behavior and presentation choices | Host project |

## Compatibility

A release validates a complete pipeline:

- CSWMapGenerator version producing the GZD map;
- GizmoSDK version reading and streaming it;
- C# CSW SceneManager command-contract version;
- CSWUnity package version; and
- Unity and render-pipeline version.
